    "preamble": "Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism.\nThe only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for A.A. membership; we are self-supporting through our own contributions.\nA.A. is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy; neither endorses nor opposes any causes.\nOur primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieved sobriety.",

    "prayer_3": "God, I offer myself to Thee - To build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt.\nRelieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy will.\nTake away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness\nto those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love, and Thy Way of life.\nMay I do Thy will always!",
    "prayer_7": "My Creator, I am now willing that You should have all of me, good and bad.\nI pray that You now remove from me every single defect of character which stands in the way of my usefulness to You and my fellows. Grant me strength, as I go out from here, to do Your bidding.\nAmen.",
    "prayer_11_morning": "God, direct my thinking today so that it be empty of self pity, dishonesty, self-will, selfseeking and fear. God, inspire my thinking, decisions and intuitions.\nHelp me to relax and take it easy. Free me from doubt and indecision.\nGuide me through this day and show me my next step. God, show me what I need to do to take care of any problems.\nI ask all these things that I may be of maximum service to you and my fellow man.\nIn the spirit of the Steps I pray.\nAmen.",
    "prayer_11_night": "God, forgive me where I have been resentful, selfish, dishonest or afraid today.\nHelp me to not keep anything to myself but to discuss it all openly with another person - show me where I owe an apology and help me make it.\nHelp me to be kind and loving to all people.\nUse me in the mainstream of life, God.\nFree me of worry, remorse or morbid (sick) reflections that I may be of usefulness to others.\nAmen.",
    "prayer_st_francis": "Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace!\nThat where there is hatred, I may bring love.\nThat where there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness.\nThat where there is discord, I may bring harmony.\nThat where there is error, I may bring truth.\nThat where there is doubt, I may bring faith.\nThat where there is despair, I may bring hope.\nThat where there are shadows, I may bring light.\nThat where there is sadness, I may bring joy.\nLord, grant that I may seek rather to comfort, than to be comforted.\nTo understand, than to be understood.\nTo love, than to be loved.\nFor it is by self-forgetting that one finds.\nIt is by forgiving that one is forgiven.\nIt is by dying that one awakens to Eternal Life.",
    "prayer_acceptance": "When I stopped living in the problem and began living in the answer, the problem went away.\nFrom that moment on, I have not had a single compulsion to drink.\nAnd acceptance is the answer to all my problems today.\nWhen I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing or situation - some fact of my life - unacceptable to me.\nI can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment.\nNothing, absolutely nothing, happens in God’s world by mistake.\nUntil I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life’s terms, I cannot be happy.\nI need to concentrate not so much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and my attitudes.",
    "j4t_1": "Just for today I will try to live through this day only & not tackle my whole life problem at once. I can do something for twelve hours that would appall me if I felt that I had to keep it up for a lifetime.",
    "j4t_2": "Just for today I will be happy. Most folks are as happy as they make up their minds to be.",
    "j4t_3": "Just for today I will adjust myself to what is & not try to adjust everything else to my desires. I will take my “luck” as it comes & fit myself into it.",
    "j4t_4": "Just for today I will try to strengthen my mind. I will study; I will learn something useful; I will not be a mental loafer; I will read something that requires effort, thought & concentration.",
    "j4t_5": "Just for today I will exercise my soul in three ways: I will do somebody a good turn & not get found out; if anybody knows of it, it will not count; I will do at least two things I don’t want to do–just for exercise. I will not show anyone that my feelings are hurt; they may be hurt, but today I will not show it.",
    "j4t_6": "Just for today I will be agreeable. I will look as good as I can, dress becomingly, talk low, act courteously, criticize not one bit, not find fault with anything & not try to improve or regulate anybody except myself.",
    "j4t_7": "Just for today I will have a program. I may not follow it exactly, but I will have it. I will save myself from two pests: hurry & indecision.",
    "j4t_8": "Just for today I will have a quiet half hour all by myself & relax. During this half hour, sometime, I will try to get a better perspective on my life.",
    "j4t_9": "Just for today I will be unafraid. I will enjoy that which is beautiful & will believe that as I give to the world, so the world will give to me.",
    "hiw_1": "Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are less than average. There are those, too, who suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to be honest.",
    "hiw_2": "Our stories disclose in a general way what we used to be like, what happened, and what we are like now. If you have decided you want what we have and are willing to go to any length to get it — then you are ready to take certain steps.",
    "hiw_3": "At some of these we balked. We thought we could find an easier, softer way. But we could not. With all the earnestness at our command, we beg of you to be fearless and thorough from the very start. Some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result was nil until we let go absolutely.",
    "hiw_4": "Remember that we deal with alcohol — cunning, baffling, powerful! Without help it is too much for us. But there is One who has all power — that One is God. May you find Him now.",
    "hiw_5": "Half measures availed us nothing. We stood at the turning point. We asked His protection and care with complete abandon.",
    "hiw_6": "Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of recovery:",
    "hiw_7": "Many of us exclaimed, “What an order! I can’t go through with it.’’ Do not be discouraged. No one among us has been able to maintain anything like perfect adherence to these principles. We are not saints. The point is, that we are willing to grow along spiritual lines. The principles we have set down are guides to progress. We claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual perfection.",
    "hiw_8": "Our description of the alcoholic, the chapter to the agnostic, and our personal adventures before and after make clear three pertinent ideas:",
    "hiw_9": "(a) That we were alcoholic and could not manage our own lives.\n(b) That probably no human power could have relieved our alcoholism.\n(c) That God could and would if He were sought.",
